    "# Working with Language Models in Teradata: CompleteChat in-DB function\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **Design Pattern 3** for integrating Large Language Models with Teradata — making API calls to external inference servers directly from SQL queries. **Available from Teradata Version 16.20**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Teradata's Three Design Patterns for LLMs:**\n",
    "- **Design Pattern 1:** Run small models directly on AMP CPUs for maximum performance with lightweight models that fit in memory.\n",
    "- **Design Pattern 2:** Deploy containerized models using the Open Analytics Framework (OAF) for medium-sized models requiring isolated execution environments.\n",
    "- **Design Pattern 3:** Call external inference servers via API for large models (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Ollama, NVIDIA Triton) that are too large to run locally or require specialized hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Design Pattern 3 with CompleteChat:**\n",
    "- Leverage Teradata's MPP architecture where each AMP processes its data partition and makes parallel API calls to the LLM service, dramatically accelerating throughput compared to sequential processing.\n",
    "- Keep your data in Teradata throughout the entire workflow — no need to use glueware for external processing, maintaining security and governance controls.\n",
    "- Integrate LLM inference seamlessly into SQL-based ETL pipelines using familiar syntax and standard database operations.\n",
    "- Connect to any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, giving you flexibility to use commercial providers or self-hosted open-source models.\n",
    "- Built-in rate limiting, retry logic, and error handling ensure reliable batch processing at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:**\n",
    "Text summarization, sentiment analysis, classification, entity extraction, content generation, and any scenario where you need to enrich structured data with LLM-powered insights."

       "5       A severe storm caused widespread power outages across three counties, prompting emergency services to work around the clock to restore essential services. More than 150,000 households were left without electricity as high winds damaged power lines and transformer stations. Emergency shelters were opened at community centers to provide refuge for displaced residents. Utility companies deployed additional crews from neighboring states to expedite restoration efforts. Officials estimate it may take up to a week to fully restore power to all affected areas.           Storm leaves 150k homes powerless; restoration expected within a week."

    "# CompleteChat Usage Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "CompleteChat is a function that leverages Teradata's Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) architecture to enable high-performance integration with OpenAI-compatible inference servers. When you execute a SQL query using CompleteChat, Teradata's Parsing Engine distributes the work across multiple Access Module Processors (AMPs). Each AMP independently processes its portion of the input table and makes API calls to the LLM service in parallel, as shown in the diagram. This parallel execution dramatically accelerates processing of large datasets compared to sequential API calls from a single client.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](docs/teradata_openai_client_sql_function_flow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The function seamlessly integrates into SQL workflows, making it an ideal component for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. You can combine CompleteChat with standard SQL operations—joins, filters, aggregations, and transformations—to build sophisticated data processing workflows entirely within Teradata. For example, you can extract customer feedback from a data warehouse, transform it using CompleteChat for sentiment analysis or summarization, and load the enriched results into a target table, all within a single SQL statement. This eliminates the need to export data to external systems for AI processing, maintaining data security and governance while reducing latency and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function sends HTTP requests to inference servers that implement the OpenAI Chat Completion API standard. Each row in the input table generates a separate API call, with the `txt` column content serving as the user prompt. The model's response is returned as a new column in the output table, alongside all original input columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "CompleteChat includes built-in rate limiting and retry logic to handle server capacity constraints gracefully. When a server returns a 429 (Too Many Requests) response, the function automatically retries the request according to the configured delay schedule. This makes it suitable for batch processing scenarios where temporary rate limits are expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use CompleteChat\n",
    "\n",
    "CompleteChat enables data-centric AI workflows by bringing model inference directly into the database layer. This approach offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Massively Parallel Processing**: Leverage Teradata's MPP architecture to process millions of rows in parallel, with each AMP making independent API calls to maximize throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Locality**: Process data where it resides, avoiding costly data movement and maintaining data governance controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Integration**: Use familiar SQL syntax to incorporate AI capabilities into existing queries, views, and stored procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ETL Pipeline Integration**: Seamlessly embed LLM inference into Extract, Transform, Load workflows, enabling end-to-end data processing without external tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch Processing**: Efficiently process large datasets with automatic handling of rate limits and retries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flexibility**: Connect to multiple inference providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, NVIDIA Triton, Ollama) using a consistent interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security**: Support for custom TLS certificates ensures secure communication with enterprise inference servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is particularly valuable for use cases such as text summarization, classification, sentiment analysis, entity extraction, and content generation at scale. By combining SQL's data manipulation capabilities with LLM inference and Teradata's parallel processing power, you can build sophisticated AI pipelines without leaving the database environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications that benefit from CompleteChat include customer feedback analysis, automated content moderation, document processing, personalized content generation, and data enrichment workflows. The function's configurable parameters allow fine-tuning of model behavior (temperature, penalties) and operational characteristics (retries, timeouts) to match specific requirements."

    "3. **Install the JAR file:** The Java archive containing the CompleteChat table operator is installed into Teradata using `SQLJ.INSTALL_JAR` and registered with the identifier `OPENAI_CLIENT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create the CompleteChat function:** The function is registered as a table operator that returns varying table results, using the `OpenAIClientTO_contract` interface and the `OpenAIClientTO.execute()` method from the installed JAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** The CompleteChat function becomes available as `openai_client.CompleteChat()` and can be called from any SQL query by users with appropriate permissions."
