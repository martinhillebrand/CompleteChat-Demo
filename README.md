# CompleteChat - Teradata LLM Integration

A Teradata table operator that enables SQL-based integration with OpenAI-compatible inference servers. 
CompleteChat leverages Teradata's Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) architecture to perform LLM inference at scale, 
with each AMP making parallel API calls to process its data partition. This implementation represents **Design Pattern 3** for working with Language Models in Teradataâ€”calling external inference servers directly from SQL queries to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into ETL workflows without moving data outside the database.
